hm
why hasn't golang-1.6 migrated from -proposed to -updates in trusty yet?
i thought it would happen after a week
(and the bug was verification-done)
http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/pending-sru.html -> seems green, but its probably because there's no golang-1.6 in trusty main
so might need manual push
w
ah ok
It's always manual.
It needs a human to say "yep, let's do that".
And we don't tend to release on weekends.
Though, for a NEW package, it can't hurt.
Released.
what is this weekend you speak of
thanks
The weekend is the time when a large number of our developers shockingly aren't glued to their keyboards and would prefer not to deal with the flood of bug reports a bad SRU can cause.
Weird, I know.  Since some of us have brain uplinks.
it's already monday afternoon though!
(Well, it's both about developer response time, and about not breaking corporate users with unattended-upgrades and a similar 5-day schedule)
Not in the correct part of the world!
'correct'!
You heard me.
I see stockholm has its claws into you
I lived in the future for five years.  It didn't agree with me.

bug 1564767 in webapps-sprint "Wrong size of embedded window" [Critical,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1564767
I've attached a patch, generated with quilt on top of the existing debian/patches
thanks, sure it should be possible. can you submit it to https://launchpadlibrarian.net/251636878/xcb_fix_parent_screen_of_embedded_windows.patch ASAP? we shouldn't carry a patch if it's not approved by upstream.
sorry, to where?
hah, https://codereview.qt-project.org/ I was meaning to paste
maybe look through http://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtbase.git/log/src/plugins/platforms/xcb/qxcbwindow.cpp too if there's something to backport instead of your patch
but are they still interested in Qt 5.5?
no, they'd be interested in 5.6 though if it's affected by the same bug
and most likely 5.6 branch is the best place to offer a fix too in, they merge from there to 5.7 and dev.
I'll now test 5.6, but looking at their code, I believe they've already fixed it
the problem is, it's not just one patch to backport, but many
ok, to me it'd look like the line of code in question is still unchanged, just a variable name changed. but maybe it was fixed elsewhere?
we actually have a lot of XCB fixes already in, in order to try to fix multi-monitor issues that plagued 5.5 still (and maybe even 5.6 still too).
but at this point I'd tend to agree that if it's yet another multiple patches, it would be better to take your two-liner patch instead
yes, that function is still there in Qt 5.6, but handleConfigureNotifyEvent() doesn't call that method anymore :-)
but let's see, I'm installing 5.6 and I'll let you know
ok!
Hi Martin, Time to look at the FFe request at bug #1556457 (fontconfig 2.11.1 -> 2.11.94)?
bug 1556457 in fontconfig (Ubuntu) "[FFe] Demilight (OS/2 weight=350) confuses fontconfig" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1556457
yes, 5.6 works! :-)
but given how deep are the chanegs in teh XCB plugin between 5.5 and 5.6, I think it's quite risky to try a backport (also because we already have quite a few debian/patches touching XCB)
ok! :) then you don't need to submit anything to upstream since indeed they've forgotten about 5.5 by now (because 5.6 is LTS). so it may be your patch is simply the best way.
I agree, unless some of the already backported patches form a baseline on top of which one more could be cherry-picked, but I somehow doubt that too
it just happened I got my previous qtbase xenial upload done so I'll start preparing the next one but not with what I had on my mind earlier (not so important) but your patch instead
excellent, thanks a lot!

bluez-gstreamer wine1.6 gnome-media need recompile against gstreamer 1.0; they depend on gstreamer 0.10 in Xenial o.o
not sure if that's fixable at this stage though
(also bah the Wine team, they didn't get Wine 1.8 in Xenial even though it's been out since before Wily)
we (Android Tools Debian team) finally got all of our current packages into Debian/testing.  xenial is mostly in sync, but there are two packages with packaging fixes that have not been fixed: android-platfrom-system-core and android-platform-tools-base
oops, have not been synced
should I do requestsync?
yes please
ok will do
do you want to try the requestsync, or shall I?
I'm not familiar with that ...
ok, I can do it, its basically a webform in launchpad
i'd be happy to run 'requestsync' for you if you need
then give you the bug # to make your comments ;)
this close to final freeze, though, how critical are the package updates :P
Hmm I would wait for some time
s/final freeze/final release/
I think they are essential, and these are new packages that nothing else depends on, so they are low risk changes
the new packages do depend on each other
for example, one change is a typoed package name in depends
Do we have any deadlines?
yeah, final release is very soon
final freeze is next week I think

OK, fire at will ;)
android-platfrom-system-core and android-platform-tools-base ?
and from Debian Testing?
the first package is https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/android-platform-system-core
and from Testing or Unstable?
hold off on -tools-base
(where do you want the sync req. to come from)
unstable and testing should be the same, it just happened, but unstable to be safe
hmm

I think we're good then unless seamlik has something to add
did anyone contact the phone team about these packages (since they maintain their own patched versions of i.e. adb, adbd and fastboot)
I think we've had some contact.  these packages don't touch the original android-tools source package, which is what Ubuntu uses for adb, adbd, and fastboot
ok
Ubuntu already has its own android-tools anyway, for a while now
we tried to sync it at one point
well, that's all we need for now :)
it would be great to move adb and fastboot out of the android-tools package.  We have more up-to-date adb and fastboot building in the Android Tools Team packages, but they only build on amd64 and i386.  So someone would need to port things to all the other archs to fully replace the android-tools source package
you would have to pull in the patches to the udev rules
(that are added to support ubuntu devices)
(beyond that fastboot and adb binaries shoudl be fine to use vanilla ... adbd not though  ... taklk to the guys in #ubuntu-touch)

because you have reason to care :)
also what juju upstream supports should not matter what ubuntu archive compiles.
Yeah
rbasak, e.g. it should be totally valid to have a client on 32bit controlling 64bit deployments....
I think I should change it to "any".
If it FTBFS on some archs, then the release team can decide whether to let that in or not.
It doesn't seem right to just turn it off on an arch, since I understand that makes life hard for porters who want a particular arch to work well across the archive.

quite possibly! let's see
i believe i'm down to the last 9 packages that need updating, fyi; a few will be in a broken state (e.g., drupal7 pending drupal8 or drupal7 updates) and i'm still contacting upstreams for a few to see if they have php7 versions we can pull down
but i think we'll be in a position to remove src:php5 soon, if you want, with minimal breakage to the archive, afaict
nacc, great!
my count of remaining affected packages Friday was higher than yours; was your count including or excluding things that were still awaiting sponsorship at the time?
are any of the php5/php7 changes you've been shepherding in any way capable of removing a user from the sudo group? specifically anything related to libapache2-mod-php5 and/or a2enmod ?
I'm thinking .postinst mostly
including those things still awaiting sponsorship. My count was more of what is left to touch list; the official reverse-depends count is 30 right now, but i submitted a bunch today and some are false-positives due to php5 | php
hrm, in general, i've not changed any fucntionality in the postints, beyond calling the right command (for php5enmod -> phpenmod) or right parameter (a2endmod php5 -> a2endmod php)
so I'd be surprised if that happened, but I'm not going to make any guaranteed; do you have a specific package in mind?
or a bug, i guess? :)
ok.  my count as of Friday was 56, and a couple of those are already on the removals list (php-imap, php-mcrypt) but we should reconcile these counts soonish :)
maybe you could run your eyes over the following pastebin? A user in #ubuntu+1 reported it and I did some 'live' debugging and we couldn't figure it out, so not even sure it is a bug, and the user re-added themselves so the issue is now dead. http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/15585996/
yep, let's plan on syncing this afternoon?
+1
looking; but fwiw, i've not actually touched the src:php5 itself, which is a bit out of sync with debian probably
it's goign to be removed
so i'd just suggest to that user they need to migrate asap :)
and/or reproduce it with php7
right... I just wanted to do a heads up since we're so close to release... the trigger might have been a2enmod rather than the package install; hard to know but would be awful for that to escape into the wild
yep, i'll try and reproduce it here in a bit?
infinity, hi
well no great pressure, as I said, the user re-added themselves from a recovery boot and I couldn't find any other mentions of similar stuff. It was a fresh clean install of 16.04 about 45 minutes before it happened, though.
ok, np; but first, lunch! :)
supper :)
Hi.
infinity, because of cups-filters. I do not know whether you know that I have made use of the fact that one could run LSB-compliant packages on Ubuntu.
infinity, for this there was an "lsb" package. Debian pulled this feature out, very shortly before our FF, not letting me a chance to introduce a new package.
infinity, so as LSB compatibility was actually only used by us to allow manufacturers to supply printer drivers, I have simply re-introduced the LSB compatibility by taking the stuff which was taken out of the lsb package into cups-filters.
infinity, only that I forgot the postinst  in the first place and got a bug report because of this and added it today to complete my work.
Yes, I followed your bug report to see what you were doing.  cups should not, in any way, be responsible for providing ld.so links, however.
infinity, so does this mean that I should say LSB driver support is skipped on the LTS or forever?
No, it means you should probably talk to Foundations people before deciding to hack around something like this in a printer driver package. :P
zend-framework> the prior-version argument to dpkg-maintscript-helper mv_conffile is strongly recommended
If we decide LSB ld.so links belong anywhere, it should be something reasonably low-level, either a re-introduction of some lsb thing, or in glibc itself.
(not blocking this upload on it, but you really want that there so that things eventually clean up)
Surely, you see how your method would immediately go sideways if someone else also decides they need that functionality.
infinity, so what I could perhaps do then is to recover the lsb-source package to its old state, of before Debian took everything out and sync cups-filters with Debian to remove all LSB stuff from it. OK?
I don't think reverting lsb is sane either.  But leave it to slangasek and I to sort out the best way to solve this one.  cups-filters definitely shouldn't have an lsb package, though.
I added some more info to the description of the bugs. the secret keys didn't get migrated
infinity, slangasek, so please check and tell me what is the best solution for that.
infinity, slangasek, the solution can be a short-term solution for 16.04 only. On the OpenPrinting Summit I will tell manufacturers that the LSB is dead for printing as one of the two principal distro families left the LSB.
an LTS in not "short term"; anything deployed here has to be supported on upgrade for 2 years, so needs to be designed carefully. I'm fairly certain the right answer is to put the symlinks in glibc, but I'll leave that to infinity to confirm
infinity, slangasek, the package in which the symlinks where before was lsb-core, coming from the lsb source package.
we're aware
I'm not quite sure, but I think all of these debian package build tools hate me :/
why does yubikey-ksm call phpenmod in its postinst for a module it does not ship?

you sponsored the upload that reintroduced the recommends: on vblade-persist from vblade
Ah
is it code for running autoreconf or something?
ah yes, I remember now. Sorry! Yeah cpaelzer is right. That was to bring vblade closer to sync with Debian so we can stop caring for it in universe next cycle. So no MIR any more so no further action I think.
(the conffile move needs a delta but that can go > Xenial)
did vblade get uploaded to drop the MIR?  (I haven't looked at any of this, was just poking the bug via component-mismatches)
I wasn't aware of the MIR at the time. It was in MoM as needing a merge. We looked, decided we didn't want to maintain a delta, so merged it dropping most of the delta for a graceful removal next cycle.
ok, you can't just drop the delta.  It's a component-mismatch; packages in main need to not recommend packages in universe
it was confusing to have an MIR bug still around from before vblade was promoted, but this still needs to be dealt with
sorry, I missed that.
my recommendation, given the goal of minimizing delta, is to change that Recommends back to a Suggests in vblade; the alternative is to try to make vblade-persist work without ruinit
sorry, "runit" ;P
I think we might be able to drop vblade from server-ship and get it into universe.

yeah
it seems like something is not putting in the lib dependency
that symbol is from raphf
but `ldd` indicates http.so doesn't load raphf.so, which seems like a mistake
trying to figure out what's mssing
see also dlopen()
raphf.so, implies it's not a library but a plugin of its own; so linking to it is likely wrong
yeah
true; but not called in this library, and not linked against libdl
which means it's a runtime dependency
http.so probably assumes this symbol is resolvable through the parent
by raphf.so being loaded first
so maybe it's an ordering thing
could be
istr something about the order of names does matter
let me see if i can find it
is it being linked with -Wl,--no-undefined?
could also be a scoping issue with the options php itself passes to dlopen()
that would fail at build time if it were
right

anyway memory you can do with no privilege with or without cgm;  cpu you'd need to edit /etc/pam.d/common-session to add ",cpu" to the libpam-cgfs line
so in the meantime i'd recommend yeah use cgm.  I think we should come up wiht a good systemd based answer and put that into the server guide
OK, thanks
[21:58]  * rbasak reads up
may have found the pecl-http issue, typo -- checking to see if it fixes it
Who's taking ownership of evaluating the removal of the block-proposed tag from https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/squid3/+bug/1473691 ?
Launchpad bug 1473691 in squid3 (Ubuntu) "[FFe] squid: Update to latest upstream release (3.5)" [Critical,Fix committed]
^^
Or rharper maybe?
We're probably approaching a point where we're not going to find any more bugs without inflicting it on users.
I've seen activity, but I'm not sure who's holding the baton right now.
last I saw was a 1ubuntu4 upload with some fixes from slangasek on the maint scripts;
And another from me, yes.
I can give the proposed package a test; but since it was maint stuff, I don't it to modify the functionality w.r.t universe packages we were testing
I didn't get any time to test additional rdepends on squid3 from universe yet;
we did want to maybe see about maas and squid3
Well, we're running out of time to "see about" anything.
I don't see any reason to hold back
better to get the hurt ASAP
any known issues with what is in -proposed currently?
That was sort of my thinking.
Sorry, I haven't really been following along.
none that I'm aware of
I'm sure we missed some bugs, but I've fixed the ones *I* run into.
So, I need other people to find more. :P
OK, let's drop the tag as I don't hear any objections.
[22:03]  * rharper nods 
unless we want to risk keeping squid3 out-of-date for another LTS, we should let 'er rip
heh
not after all of this trouble
And someone might want to merge the new upstream after we let this one through.
Because more bugs.
3.5.15 (new stable IIRC)
yes there may be some knock-on effects, but we need to find them before we can sort them out, and at this point we need it in xenial before we're likely to find them
yep
I saw activity on bug 1448149. I think that probably doesn't affect Xenial?
bug 1448149 in squidguard (Ubuntu) "Squid 3.3.8 incompatible with squidGuard 1.5-4" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1448149
[22:04]  * infinity removes the tag.
(in fact it would be fixed by Xenial?)
yes
fixed
Lovely. Thanks!
at least with the trivial test case kick1nz setup
cool
nm, didnt' fix it (but is a real bugfix :)
netmrg is dep-wait on all archs
looks like an outdated build-dep on libmysqlclient15-dev?
I have that on my list to fix.
i believe it's due to the pending migration
Right
what's pending that's causing it to dep-wait?
Is https://launchpad.net/~mysql-ubuntu/+archive/ubuntu/mysql-5.7/+sourcepub/6249018/+listing-archive-extra helpful?
That's our test build.
rharper, do you know if maas got any testing done on squid3 proposed?  they said they'd have to make changes in maas.
$ apt-cache showpkg libmysqlclient15-dev
Unable to locate package libmysqlclient15-dev
$
sorry, i mean the deps need to be updated, but that the sql migration is going to fix it (or needs to)
s/libmysqlclient15-dev/libmysqlclient-dev/. They're equivalent. We dropped the virtual package from MySQL 5.7 that's in proposed.
nacc, rbasak: right, so netmgr should get reuploaded with the fixed build-dep and afaics that doesn't need to wait for anything else
(then once built, will block in -proposed as part of the mysql-5.7 transition - but should get done sooner than late so as to not itself block mysql-5.7?)
good point; rbasak want me to submit the debdiff?
roaksoax,  squid3 block-proposed just removed, so it'll migrate assuming no failures.
No need, I have it local.
(already done, just not uploaded)
ok, thanks
and is lasso on your todo list?
Already has migrated, in fact.
it's in my queue of uploads for the transition.
infinity, ah..
(netmrg that is)
I was holding back in case we decided to not do the transition.
I think we're past the point of turning back.
I was going to talk to infinity about it.
Worst case scenario, we drop mysql-proxy and myodbc, and the rest of the world looked okay, right?
OK. I'll begin tomorrow morning :)
AFAICT, yes.
Yeah.  Let's do it, then.
ah, k
urgh, that doesn't show up in `reverse-depends` ... how strange
oh wait, it will
ack
I can demote those to -proposed when the rest is looking alright, and we can outright remove them from the archive when we're sure that's the right thing to do.
rbasak, infinity: oh, er, myodbc is already broken in the archive, if you didn't know
yes, on my list
It is?
yes, it built and then had undefined symbols and I decided I had better things to do with my life
Awesome.
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/myodbc/+bug/1010044
Launchpad bug 1010044 in myodbc (Ubuntu) "program crashes saying "undefined symbol: strfill"" [Undecided,Confirmed]
upstream are working on fixing up myodbc for us. We can land that late I guess, since there's no risk of regression then.
File a removal in Debian and yank it from Ubuntu and wash your hands of it? :P
^^ FYI.
that says it's been broken for 4 years, hth
well that certainly makes life easier. Thanks :)
I feel a little less bad about some of my underloved Debian packages now.  At least mine run.
trade you upstreams
Though, I suppose yours is quite secure.
ok.  How about libkolab? Its runtime dep is on phpapi-20131226, not on php5-*
unbreakably secure
yes, it shows up due the build-dep
ok
i haven't fixed any build-deps on src:php5
or very few
fwiw here's my current watchlist: (grep-dctrl -n -sSource:Package -FDepends php5 -o -FDepends phpapi-20131226 /var/lib/apt/lists/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_xenial_*binary-amd64_Packages; grep-dctrl -n -sPackage -FBuild-Depends,Build-Depends-Indep php5 /var/lib/apt/lists/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_xenial_*Sources)   | sort -u
Huh.  How is it 16:21 already?  I guess I should go find breakfast or lunch or whatever.
ok, thanks ... that's handy to have
the day just flies by, doesn't it?
NB that only looks at release pocket, not -proposed, so season to taste
right
wow, watershed demoted!
